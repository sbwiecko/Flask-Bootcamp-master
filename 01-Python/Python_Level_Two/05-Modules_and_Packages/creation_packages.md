# Creation of packages of modules

1. Create a folder _MainPackage_ for the **package**
2. Inside the package folder, create a subfolder _SubPackage_
3. To tell python to treat the directories as package and not directories, create an empty file `__init__.py` in both folders
4. Place the different modules in the different folders
